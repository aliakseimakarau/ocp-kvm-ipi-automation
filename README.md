# OpenShift on KVM IPI Installation Automation for IBM Z / LinuxONE

This repository contains Ansible playbooks to automate the setup of a dedicated s390x Linux LPAR for KVM hosting. The playbooks will also prepare the installation of an OpenShift cluster via the OpenShift installer 'IPI' method (installer-provisioned infrastructure) and run the actual OpenShift cluster installation process.
