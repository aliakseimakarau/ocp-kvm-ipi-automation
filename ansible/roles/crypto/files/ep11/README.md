# The purpose of this directory

This directory is solely used to *temporarily* store the EP11 binary packages needed to install the EP11 library on your target s390x Linux LPAR.
For more information on how to obtain these packages please see [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=stack-installing-host-part-ep11-library).

The `.gitignore` file in this directory will ensure that whatever you place in here will not be persisted in git.
